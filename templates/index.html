                <p class="lead">People, all around the world enjoy training in their daily life, but sometimes you can
                    have questions.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Asking questions can help ensure that you're performing the exercise most effectively
                    for
                    your body. You'll not only likely see better
                    results but also avoid potential injury this way. The Traint forum will help you with just that.</p>
